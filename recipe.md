3. Cover and keep this marinated paneer in the refrigerator for 30-40 minutes.


# Masala/Curry
1. Heat 1 tbsp of butter and 1 tbsp of oil in a pan. Once hot add cinnamon stick and cumin seeds.
2. Once the seeds crackle, add the chopped onions, crushed garlic pods and chopped ginger. Fry till onions turn golden brown in color.
3. Once onions are done, add the tomatoes and the curry powder and mix. Also add the the salt and sugar.
4. Cook the tomatoes on medium flame till they are soft, around 6-7 minutes.

10. Switch off the flame and garnish with chopped coriander leaves and cream.

# Notes
1. Use 1/2 teaspoon paprika powder in the curry for a deep red/orange color. I used paprika powder while marinating the paneer but forgot to add in the curry.
2. For a vegan version, you can skip the butter and cream and use tofu in place of paneer.
3. The quantity of butter and cream in the recipe depends on your taste and preference. The original recipe had an additional tablespoon of butter which I didn't add.
4. The paneer should ideally by grilled so in case you have a griller use that to make the tikka.
5. You can also drizzle around 1/2 teaspoon of lemon juice on the curry once it's done.
6. If you want, you can strain the pureed mixture before putting it back in the pan. This will just make the curry totally smooth.
